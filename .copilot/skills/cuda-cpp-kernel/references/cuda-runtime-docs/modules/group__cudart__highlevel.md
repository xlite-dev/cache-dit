__host__ cudaChannelFormatDesc cudaCreateChannelDesc ( void ) [inline]


[C++ API] Returns a channel descriptor using the specified format

###### Returns

Channel descriptor with format `f`

###### Description

Returns a channel descriptor with format `f` and number of bits of each component `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The cudaChannelFormatDesc is defined as:


    ‎  struct cudaChannelFormatDesc {
              int x, y, z, w;
              enum cudaChannelFormatKind
                      f;
            };

where cudaChannelFormatKind is one of cudaChannelFormatKindSigned, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsigned, cudaChannelFormatKindFloat, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized8X1, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized8X2, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized8X4, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized8X1, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized8X2, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized8X4, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized16X1, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized16X2, cudaChannelFormatKindSignedNormalized16X4, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized16X1, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized16X2, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized16X4, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized1010102 or cudaChannelFormatKindNV12.

The format is specified by the template specialization.

The template function specializes for the following scalar types: char, signed char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, and float. The template function specializes for the following vector types: char{1|2|4}, uchar{1|2|4}, short{1|2|4}, ushort{1|2|4}, int{1|2|4}, uint{1|2|4}, long{1|2|4}, ulong{1|2|4}, float{1|2|4}. The template function specializes for following cudaChannelFormatKind enum values: cudaChannelFormatKind{Uns|S}ignedNormalized{8|16}X{1|2|4}, cudaChannelFormatKindUnsignedNormalized1010102 and cudaChannelFormatKindNV12.

Invoking the function on a type without a specialization defaults to creating a channel format of kind cudaChannelFormatKindNone

######  Parameters

`event`
    \- Newly created event
`flags`
    \- Flags for new event

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorLaunchFailure, cudaErrorMemoryAllocation

###### Description

Creates an event object with the specified flags. Valid flags include:

  * cudaEventDefault: Default event creation flag.

  * cudaEventBlockingSync: Specifies that event should use blocking synchronization. A host thread that uses cudaEventSynchronize() to wait on an event created with this flag will block until the event actually completes.

  * cudaEventDisableTiming: Specifies that the created event does not need to record timing data. Events created with this flag specified and the cudaEventBlockingSync flag not specified will provide the best performance when used with cudaStreamWaitEvent() and cudaEventQuery().


  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.


######  Parameters

`attr`
    \- Return pointer to function's attributes
`entry`
    \- Function to get attributes of

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction

###### Description

This function obtains the attributes of a function specified via `entry`. The parameter `entry` must be a pointer to a function that executes on the device. The parameter specified by `entry` must be declared as a `__global__` function. The fetched attributes are placed in `attr`. If the specified function does not exist, then cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction is returned.

Note that some function attributes such as maxThreadsPerBlock may vary based on the device that is currently being used.

  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

  * The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

  * Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t

`func`
    \- The function pointer to retrieve name for

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction

###### Description

Returns in `**name` the function name associated with the symbol `func` . The function name is returned as a null-terminated string. This API may return a mangled name if the function is not declared as having C linkage. If `**name` is NULL, cudaErrorInvalidValue is returned. If `func` is not a device entry function, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction is returned.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaFuncSetAttribute ( T* func, cudaFuncAttribute attr, int  value ) [inline]


[C++ API] Set attributes for a given function

######  Parameters

`func`

`attr`
    \- Attribute to set
`value`
    \- Value to set

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction, cudaErrorInvalidValue

###### Description

This function sets the attributes of a function specified via `entry`. The parameter `entry` must be a pointer to a function that executes on the device. The parameter specified by `entry` must be declared as a `__global__` function. The enumeration defined by `attr` is set to the value defined by `value`. If the specified function does not exist, then cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction is returned. If the specified attribute cannot be written, or if the value is incorrect, then cudaErrorInvalidValue is returned.

Valid values for `attr` are:

  * cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize \- The requested maximum size in bytes of dynamically-allocated shared memory. The sum of this value and the function attribute sharedSizeBytes cannot exceed the device attribute cudaDevAttrMaxSharedMemoryPerBlockOptin. The maximal size of requestable dynamic shared memory may differ by GPU architecture.

  * cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout \- On devices where the L1 cache and shared memory use the same hardware resources, this sets the shared memory carveout preference, in percent of the total shared memory. See cudaDevAttrMaxSharedMemoryPerMultiprocessor. This is only a hint, and the driver can choose a different ratio if required to execute the function.

  * cudaFuncAttributeRequiredClusterWidth: The required cluster width in blocks. The width, height, and depth values must either all be 0 or all be positive. The validity of the cluster dimensions is checked at launch time. If the value is set during compile time, it cannot be set at runtime. Setting it at runtime will return cudaErrorNotPermitted.

  * cudaFuncAttributeRequiredClusterHeight: The required cluster height in blocks. The width, height, and depth values must either all be 0 or all be positive. The validity of the cluster dimensions is checked at launch time. If the value is set during compile time, it cannot be set at runtime. Setting it at runtime will return cudaErrorNotPermitted.

  * cudaFuncAttributeRequiredClusterDepth: The required cluster depth in blocks. The width, height, and depth values must either all be 0 or all be positive. The validity of the cluster dimensions is checked at launch time. If the value is set during compile time, it cannot be set at runtime. Setting it at runtime will return cudaErrorNotPermitted.

  * cudaFuncAttributeNonPortableClusterSizeAllowed: Indicates whether the function can be launched with non-portable cluster size. 1 is allowed, 0 is disallowed.

  * cudaFuncAttributeClusterSchedulingPolicyPreference: The block scheduling policy of a function. The value type is cudaClusterSchedulingPolicy.


  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

  * The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

  * Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t

__host__ cudaError_t cudaFuncSetCacheConfig ( T* func, cudaFuncCache cacheConfig ) [inline]


[C++ API] Sets the preferred cache configuration for a device function

######  Parameters

`func`
    \- device function pointer
`cacheConfig`
    \- Requested cache configuration

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction

###### Description

On devices where the L1 cache and shared memory use the same hardware resources, this sets through `cacheConfig` the preferred cache configuration for the function specified via `func`. This is only a preference. The runtime will use the requested configuration if possible, but it is free to choose a different configuration if required to execute `func`.

`func` must be a pointer to a function that executes on the device. The parameter specified by `func` must be declared as a `__global__` function. If the specified function does not exist, then cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction is returned.

This setting does nothing on devices where the size of the L1 cache and shared memory are fixed.

Launching a kernel with a different preference than the most recent preference setting may insert a device-side synchronization point.

The supported cache configurations are:

  * cudaFuncCachePreferNone: no preference for shared memory or L1 (default)

  * cudaFuncCachePreferShared: prefer larger shared memory and smaller L1 cache

  * cudaFuncCachePreferL1: prefer larger L1 cache and smaller shared memory


  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

######  Parameters

`pGraphNode`
    \- Returns newly created node
`graph`
    \- Graph to which to add the node
`pDependencies`
    \- Dependencies of the node
`numDependencies`

`symbol`
    \- Device symbol address
`count`
    \- Size in bytes to copy
`offset`
    \- Offset from start of symbol in bytes
`kind`
    \- Type of transfer

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

###### Description

Creates a new memcpy node to copy from `symbol` and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

When the graph is launched, the node will copy `count` bytes from the memory area pointed to by `offset` bytes from the start of symbol `symbol` to the memory area pointed to by `dst`. The memory areas may not overlap. `symbol` is a variable that resides in global or constant memory space. `kind` can be either cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice, or cudaMemcpyDefault. Passing cudaMemcpyDefault is recommended, in which case the type of transfer is inferred from the pointer values. However, cudaMemcpyDefault is only allowed on systems that support unified virtual addressing.

Memcpy nodes have some additional restrictions with regards to managed memory, if the system contains at least one device which has a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess.

  * Graph objects are not threadsafe. More here.

    \- Stream identifier (defaults to NULL)

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction, cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration, cudaErrorLaunchFailure, cudaErrorLaunchTimeout, cudaErrorLaunchOutOfResources, cudaErrorSharedObjectInitFailed

###### Description

The function invokes kernel `func` on `gridDim` (`gridDim.x``gridDim.y``gridDim.z`) grid of blocks. Each block contains `blockDim` (`blockDim.x``blockDim.y``blockDim.z`) threads.

The device on which this kernel is invoked must have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrCooperativeLaunch.

The total number of blocks launched cannot exceed the maximum number of blocks per multiprocessor as returned by cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor (or cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessorWithFlags) times the number of multiprocessors as specified by the device attribute cudaDevAttrMultiProcessorCount.

The kernel cannot make use of CUDA dynamic parallelism.

If the kernel has N parameters the `args` should point to array of N pointers. Each pointer, from `args[0]` to `args[N - 1]`, point to the region of memory from which the actual parameter will be copied.

`sharedMem` sets the amount of dynamic shared memory that will be available to each thread block.

`stream` specifies a stream the invocation is associated to.

  *

  * This function exhibits asynchronous behavior for most use cases.

  * This function uses standard default stream semantics.

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

  * The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

  * Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction, cudaErrorInvalidConfiguration, cudaErrorLaunchFailure, cudaErrorLaunchTimeout, cudaErrorLaunchOutOfResources, cudaErrorSharedObjectInitFailed, cudaErrorInvalidPtx, cudaErrorUnsupportedPtxVersion, cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice, cudaErrorJitCompilerNotFound, cudaErrorJitCompilationDisabled

###### Description

Invokes the kernel `kernel` on `config->gridDim` (`config->gridDim.x``config->gridDim.y``config->gridDim.z`) grid of blocks. Each block contains `config->blockDim` (`config->blockDim.x``config->blockDim.y``config->blockDim.z`) threads.

`config->dynamicSmemBytes` sets the amount of dynamic shared memory that will be available to each thread block.

`config->stream` specifies a stream the invocation is associated to.

Configuration beyond grid and block dimensions, dynamic shared memory size, and stream can be provided with the following two fields of `config:`

`config->attrs` is an array of `config->numAttrs` contiguous cudaLaunchAttribute elements. The value of this pointer is not considered if `config->numAttrs` is zero. However, in that case, it is recommended to set the pointer to NULL. `config->numAttrs` is the number of attributes populating the first `config->numAttrs` positions of the `config->attrs` array.

The kernel arguments should be passed as arguments to this function via the `args` parameter pack.

The C API version of this function, `cudaLaunchKernelExC`, is also available for pre-C++11 compilers and for use cases where the ability to pass kernel parameters via void* array is preferable.

  * This function uses standard default stream semantics.

  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

###### Description

This is an alternate spelling for cudaMallocFromPoolAsync made available through function overloading.

######  Parameters

`ptr`
    \- Device pointer to allocated memory
`size`
    \- Requested allocation size in bytes
`flags`
    \- Requested properties of allocated memory

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorMemoryAllocation

###### Description

Allocates `size` bytes of host memory that is page-locked and accessible to the device. The driver tracks the virtual memory ranges allocated with this function and automatically accelerates calls to functions such as cudaMemcpy(). Since the memory can be accessed directly by the device, it can be read or written with much higher bandwidth than pageable memory obtained with functions such as malloc(). Allocating excessive amounts of pinned memory may degrade system performance, since it reduces the amount of memory available to the system for paging. As a result, this function is best used sparingly to allocate staging areas for data exchange between host and device.

The `flags` parameter enables different options to be specified that affect the allocation, as follows.

  * cudaHostAllocDefault: This flag's value is defined to be 0.

  * cudaHostAllocPortable: The memory returned by this call will be considered as pinned memory by all CUDA contexts, not just the one that performed the allocation.

  * cudaHostAllocMapped: Maps the allocation into the CUDA address space. The device pointer to the memory may be obtained by calling cudaHostGetDevicePointer().

  * cudaHostAllocWriteCombined: Allocates the memory as write-combined (WC). WC memory can be transferred across the PCI Express bus more quickly on some system configurations, but cannot be read efficiently by most CPUs. WC memory is a good option for buffers that will be written by the CPU and read by the device via mapped pinned memory or host->device transfers.


All of these flags are orthogonal to one another: a developer may allocate memory that is portable, mapped and/or write-combined with no restrictions.

cudaSetDeviceFlags() must have been called with the cudaDeviceMapHost flag in order for the cudaHostAllocMapped flag to have any effect.

The cudaHostAllocMapped flag may be specified on CUDA contexts for devices that do not support mapped pinned memory. The failure is deferred to cudaHostGetDevicePointer() because the memory may be mapped into other CUDA contexts via the cudaHostAllocPortable flag.

Memory allocated by this function must be freed with cudaFreeHost().

  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.


######  Parameters

`devPtr`
    \- Pointer to allocated device memory
`size`
    \- Requested allocation size in bytes
`flags`
    \- Must be either cudaMemAttachGlobal or cudaMemAttachHost (defaults to cudaMemAttachGlobal)

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorMemoryAllocation, cudaErrorNotSupported, cudaErrorInvalidValue

###### Description

Allocates `size` bytes of managed memory on the device and returns in `*devPtr` a pointer to the allocated memory. If the device doesn't support allocating managed memory, cudaErrorNotSupported is returned. Support for managed memory can be queried using the device attribute cudaDevAttrManagedMemory. The allocated memory is suitably aligned for any kind of variable. The memory is not cleared. If `size` is 0, cudaMallocManaged returns cudaErrorInvalidValue. The pointer is valid on the CPU and on all GPUs in the system that support managed memory. All accesses to this pointer must obey the Unified Memory programming model.

`flags` specifies the default stream association for this allocation. `flags` must be one of cudaMemAttachGlobal or cudaMemAttachHost. The default value for `flags` is cudaMemAttachGlobal. If cudaMemAttachGlobal is specified, then this memory is accessible from any stream on any device. If cudaMemAttachHost is specified, then the allocation should not be accessed from devices that have a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess; an explicit call to cudaStreamAttachMemAsync will be required to enable access on such devices.

If the association is later changed via cudaStreamAttachMemAsync to a single stream, the default association, as specifed during cudaMallocManaged, is restored when that stream is destroyed. For __managed__ variables, the default association is always cudaMemAttachGlobal. Note that destroying a stream is an asynchronous operation, and as a result, the change to default association won't happen until all work in the stream has completed.

Memory allocated with cudaMallocManaged should be released with cudaFree.

Device memory oversubscription is possible for GPUs that have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. Managed memory on such GPUs may be evicted from device memory to host memory at any time by the Unified Memory driver in order to make room for other allocations.

In a multi-GPU system where all GPUs have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess, managed memory may not be populated when this API returns and instead may be populated on access. In such systems, managed memory can migrate to any processor's memory at any time. The Unified Memory driver will employ heuristics to maintain data locality and prevent excessive page faults to the extent possible. The application can also guide the driver about memory usage patterns via cudaMemAdvise. The application can also explicitly migrate memory to a desired processor's memory via cudaMemPrefetchAsync.

In a multi-GPU system where all of the GPUs have a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess and all the GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other, the physical storage for managed memory is created on the GPU which is active at the time cudaMallocManaged is called. All other GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth via peer mappings over the PCIe bus. The Unified Memory driver does not migrate memory among such GPUs.

In a multi-GPU system where not all GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other and where the value of the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess is zero for at least one of those GPUs, the location chosen for physical storage of managed memory is system-dependent.

  * On Linux, the location chosen will be device memory as long as the current set of active contexts are on devices that either have peer-to-peer support with each other or have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. If there is an active context on a GPU that does not have a non-zero value for that device attribute and it does not have peer-to-peer support with the other devices that have active contexts on them, then the location for physical storage will be 'zero-copy' or host memory. Note that this means that managed memory that is located in device memory is migrated to host memory if a new context is created on a GPU that doesn't have a non-zero value for the device attribute and does not support peer-to-peer with at least one of the other devices that has an active context. This in turn implies that context creation may fail if there is insufficient host memory to migrate all managed allocations.

  * On Windows, the physical storage is always created in 'zero-copy' or host memory. All GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth over the PCIe bus. In these circumstances, use of the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is recommended to restrict CUDA to only use those GPUs that have peer-to-peer support. Alternatively, users can also set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC to a non-zero value to force the driver to always use device memory for physical storage. When this environment variable is set to a non-zero value, all devices used in that process that support managed memory have to be peer-to-peer compatible with each other. The error cudaErrorInvalidDevice will be returned if a device that supports managed memory is used and it is not peer-to-peer compatible with any of the other managed memory supporting devices that were previously used in that process, even if cudaDeviceReset has been called on those devices. These environment variables are described in the CUDA programming guide under the "CUDA environment variables" section.

  * On ARM, managed memory is not available on discrete gpu with Drive PX-2.


  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

`flags`
    \- Requested behavior for the occupancy calculator

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDevice, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*minGridSize` and `*blocksize` a suggested grid / block size pair that achieves the best potential occupancy (i.e. the maximum number of active warps with the smallest number of blocks).

The `flags` parameter controls how special cases are handle. Valid flags include:

  * cudaOccupancyDefault: keeps the default behavior as cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize


  * cudaOccupancyDisableCachingOverride: This flag suppresses the default behavior on platform where global caching affects occupancy. On such platforms, if caching is enabled, but per-block SM resource usage would result in zero occupancy, the occupancy calculator will calculate the occupancy as if caching is disabled. Setting this flag makes the occupancy calculator to return 0 in such cases. More information can be found about this feature in the "Unified L1/Texture Cache" section of the Maxwell tuning guide.


Use

######  Parameters

`clusterSize`
    \- Returned maximum cluster size that can be launched for the given kernel function and launch configuration
`func`
    \- Kernel function for which maximum cluster size is calculated
`config`
    \- Launch configuration for the given kernel function

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

The cluster dimensions in `config` are ignored. If func has a required cluster size set (see cudaFuncGetAttributes),`*clusterSize` will reflect the required cluster size.

By default this function will always return a value that's portable on future hardware. A higher value may be returned if the kernel function allows non-portable cluster sizes.

This function will respect the compile time launch bounds.

  *

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

  * The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

  * Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t


######  Parameters

`stream`
    \- Stream in which to enqueue the attach operation
`devPtr`
    \- Pointer to memory (must be a pointer to managed memory or to a valid host-accessible region of system-allocated memory)
`length`
    \- Length of memory (defaults to zero)
`flags`
    \- Must be one of cudaMemAttachGlobal, cudaMemAttachHost or cudaMemAttachSingle (defaults to cudaMemAttachSingle)

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorNotReady, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle

###### Description

Enqueues an operation in `stream` to specify stream association of `length` bytes of memory starting from `devPtr`. This function is a stream-ordered operation, meaning that it is dependent on, and will only take effect when, previous work in stream has completed. Any previous association is automatically replaced.

`devPtr` must point to an one of the following types of memories:

  * managed memory declared using the __managed__ keyword or allocated with cudaMallocManaged.

  * a valid host-accessible region of system-allocated pageable memory. This type of memory may only be specified if the device associated with the stream reports a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrPageableMemoryAccess.


For managed allocations, `length` must be either zero or the entire allocation's size. Both indicate that the entire allocation's stream association is being changed. Currently, it is not possible to change stream association for a portion of a managed allocation.

For pageable allocations, `length` must be non-zero.

The stream association is specified using `flags` which must be one of cudaMemAttachGlobal, cudaMemAttachHost or cudaMemAttachSingle. The default value for `flags` is cudaMemAttachSingle If the cudaMemAttachGlobal flag is specified, the memory can be accessed by any stream on any device. If the cudaMemAttachHost flag is specified, the program makes a guarantee that it won't access the memory on the device from any stream on a device that has a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. If the cudaMemAttachSingle flag is specified and `stream` is associated with a device that has a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess, the program makes a guarantee that it will only access the memory on the device from `stream`. It is illegal to attach singly to the NULL stream, because the NULL stream is a virtual global stream and not a specific stream. An error will be returned in this case.

When memory is associated with a single stream, the Unified Memory system will allow CPU access to this memory region so long as all operations in `stream` have completed, regardless of whether other streams are active. In effect, this constrains exclusive ownership of the managed memory region by an active GPU to per-stream activity instead of whole-GPU activity.

Accessing memory on the device from streams that are not associated with it will produce undefined results. No error checking is performed by the Unified Memory system to ensure that kernels launched into other streams do not access this region.

It is a program's responsibility to order calls to cudaStreamAttachMemAsync via events, synchronization or other means to ensure legal access to memory at all times. Data visibility and coherency will be changed appropriately for all kernels which follow a stream-association change.

If `stream` is destroyed while data is associated with it, the association is removed and the association reverts to the default visibility of the allocation as specified at cudaMallocManaged. For __managed__ variables, the default association is always cudaMemAttachGlobal. Note that destroying a stream is an asynchronous operation, and as a result, the change to default association won't happen until all work in the stream has completed.

  * Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

  * Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.
