# 6.17. Direct3D 9 Interoperability

**Source:** group__CUDART__D3D9.html#group__CUDART__D3D9


### Enumerations

enum cudaD3D9DeviceList


### Functions

__host__ cudaError_t cudaD3D9GetDevice ( int* device, const char* pszAdapterName )


Gets the device number for an adapter.

######  Parameters

`device`
    \- Returns the device corresponding to pszAdapterName
`pszAdapterName`
    \- D3D9 adapter to get device for

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*device` the CUDA-compatible device corresponding to the adapter name `pszAdapterName` obtained from EnumDisplayDevices or IDirect3D9::GetAdapterIdentifier(). If no device on the adapter with name `pszAdapterName` is CUDA-compatible then the call will fail.

######  Parameters

`pCudaDeviceCount`
    \- Returned number of CUDA devices corresponding to `pD3D9Device`
`pCudaDevices`
    \- Returned CUDA devices corresponding to `pD3D9Device`
`cudaDeviceCount`
    \- The size of the output device array `pCudaDevices`
`pD3D9Device`
    \- Direct3D 9 device to query for CUDA devices
`deviceList`
    \- The set of devices to return. This set may be cudaD3D9DeviceListAll for all devices, cudaD3D9DeviceListCurrentFrame for the devices used to render the current frame (in SLI), or cudaD3D9DeviceListNextFrame for the devices used to render the next frame (in SLI).

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorNoDevice, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*pCudaDeviceCount` the number of CUDA-compatible devices corresponding to the Direct3D 9 device `pD3D9Device`. Also returns in `*pCudaDevices` at most `cudaDeviceCount` of the the CUDA-compatible devices corresponding to the Direct3D 9 device `pD3D9Device`.

If any of the GPUs being used to render `pDevice` are not CUDA capable then the call will return cudaErrorNoDevice.

######  Parameters

`ppD3D9Device`
    \- Returns the Direct3D device for this thread

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidGraphicsContext, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*ppD3D9Device` the Direct3D device against which this CUDA context was created in cudaD3D9SetDirect3DDevice().

######  Parameters

`pD3D9Device`
    \- Direct3D device to use for this thread
`device`
    \- The CUDA device to use. This device must be among the devices returned when querying cudaD3D9DeviceListAll from cudaD3D9GetDevices, may be set to -1 to automatically select an appropriate CUDA device.

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorSetOnActiveProcess

###### Description

Records `pD3D9Device` as the Direct3D 9 device to use for Direct3D 9 interoperability with the CUDA device `device` and sets `device` as the current device for the calling host thread.

This function will immediately initialize the primary context on `device` if needed.

If `device` has already been initialized then this call will fail with the error cudaErrorSetOnActiveProcess. In this case it is necessary to reset `device` using cudaDeviceReset() before Direct3D 9 interoperability on `device` may be enabled.

Successfully initializing CUDA interoperability with `pD3D9Device` will increase the internal reference count on `pD3D9Device`. This reference count will be decremented when `device` is reset using cudaDeviceReset().

Note that this function is never required for correct functionality. Use of this function will result in accelerated interoperability only when the operating system is Windows Vista or Windows 7, and the device `pD3DDdevice` is not an IDirect3DDevice9Ex. In all other cirumstances, this function is not necessary.

######  Parameters

`resource`
    \- Pointer to returned resource handle
`pD3DResource`
    \- Direct3D resource to register
`flags`
    \- Parameters for resource registration

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDevice, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Registers the Direct3D 9 resource `pD3DResource` for access by CUDA.

If this call is successful then the application will be able to map and unmap this resource until it is unregistered through cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource(). Also on success, this call will increase the internal reference count on `pD3DResource`. This reference count will be decremented when this resource is unregistered through cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource().

This call potentially has a high-overhead and should not be called every frame in interactive applications.

The type of `pD3DResource` must be one of the following.

  * IDirect3DVertexBuffer9: may be accessed through a device pointer

  * IDirect3DIndexBuffer9: may be accessed through a device pointer

  * IDirect3DSurface9: may be accessed through an array. Only stand-alone objects of type IDirect3DSurface9 may be explicitly shared. In particular, individual mipmap levels and faces of cube maps may not be registered directly. To access individual surfaces associated with a texture, one must register the base texture object.

  * IDirect3DBaseTexture9: individual surfaces on this texture may be accessed through an array.


The `flags` argument may be used to specify additional parameters at register time. The valid values for this parameter are

  * cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsNone: Specifies no hints about how this resource will be used.

  * cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsSurfaceLoadStore: Specifies that CUDA will bind this resource to a surface reference.

  * cudaGraphicsRegisterFlagsTextureGather: Specifies that CUDA will perform texture gather operations on this resource.


Not all Direct3D resources of the above types may be used for interoperability with CUDA. The following are some limitations.

  * The primary rendertarget may not be registered with CUDA.

  * Resources allocated as shared may not be registered with CUDA.

  * Textures which are not of a format which is 1, 2, or 4 channels of 8, 16, or 32-bit integer or floating-point data cannot be shared.

  * Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.


A complete list of supported formats is as follows:

  * D3DFMT_L8

  * D3DFMT_L16

  * D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8

  * D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8

  * D3DFMT_G16R16

  * D3DFMT_A8B8G8R8

  * D3DFMT_A8

  * D3DFMT_A8L8

  * D3DFMT_Q8W8V8U8

  * D3DFMT_V16U16

  * D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16F

  * D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16

  * D3DFMT_R32F

  * D3DFMT_G16R16F

  * D3DFMT_A32B32G32R32F

  * D3DFMT_G32R32F

  * D3DFMT_R16F


If `pD3DResource` is of incorrect type or is already registered, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pD3DResource` cannot be registered, then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.
