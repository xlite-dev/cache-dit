**Source:** group__CUDART__D3D10__DEPRECATED.html#group__CUDART__D3D10__DEPRECATED


### Enumerations

enum cudaD3D10MapFlags

enum cudaD3D10RegisterFlags


### Functions

__host__ cudaError_t cudaD3D10GetDirect3DDevice ( ID3D10Device** ppD3D10Device )


Gets the Direct3D device against which the current CUDA context was created.

######  Parameters

`ppD3D10Device`
    \- Returns the Direct3D device for this thread

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 5.0.

###### Description

This function is deprecated and should no longer be used. It is no longer necessary to associate a CUDA device with a D3D10 device in order to achieve maximum interoperability performance.

######  Parameters

`count`
    \- Number of resources to map for CUDA
`ppResources`
    \- Resources to map for CUDA

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Maps the `count` Direct3D resources in `ppResources` for access by CUDA.

The resources in `ppResources` may be accessed in CUDA kernels until they are unmapped. Direct3D should not access any resources while they are mapped by CUDA. If an application does so, the results are undefined.

This function provides the synchronization guarantee that any Direct3D calls issued before cudaD3D10MapResources() will complete before any CUDA kernels issued after cudaD3D10MapResources() begin.

If any of `ppResources` have not been registered for use with CUDA or if `ppResources` contains any duplicate entries then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If any of `ppResources` are presently mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

######  Parameters

`pResource`
    \- Resource to register
`flags`
    \- Parameters for resource registration

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidDevice, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Registers the Direct3D resource `pResource` for access by CUDA.

If this call is successful, then the application will be able to map and unmap this resource until it is unregistered through cudaD3D10UnregisterResource(). Also on success, this call will increase the internal reference count on `pResource`. This reference count will be decremented when this resource is unregistered through cudaD3D10UnregisterResource().

This call potentially has a high-overhead and should not be called every frame in interactive applications.

The type of `pResource` must be one of the following:

  * ID3D10Buffer: Cannot be used with `flags` set to `cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsArray`.

  * ID3D10Texture1D: No restrictions.

  * ID3D10Texture2D: No restrictions.

  * ID3D10Texture3D: No restrictions.


The `flags` argument specifies the mechanism through which CUDA will access the Direct3D resource. The following values are allowed.

  * cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsNone: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource through a `void*`. The pointer, size, and pitch for each subresource of this resource may be queried through cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer(), cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedSize(), and cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPitch() respectively. This option is valid for all resource types.

  * cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsArray: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource through a `CUarray` queried on a sub-resource basis through cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedArray(). This option is only valid for resources of type ID3D10Texture1D, ID3D10Texture2D, and ID3D10Texture3D.


Not all Direct3D resources of the above types may be used for interoperability with CUDA. The following are some limitations.

  * The primary rendertarget may not be registered with CUDA.

  * Resources allocated as shared may not be registered with CUDA.

  * Textures which are not of a format which is 1, 2, or 4 channels of 8, 16, or 32-bit integer or floating-point data cannot be shared.

  * Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.


If Direct3D interoperability is not initialized on this context then cudaErrorInvalidDevice is returned. If `pResource` is of incorrect type or is already registered then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` cannot be registered then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

######  Parameters

`ppArray`
    \- Returned array corresponding to subresource
`pResource`
    \- Mapped resource to access
`subResource`
    \- Subresource of pResource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Returns in `*ppArray` an array through which the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource `pResource` which corresponds to `subResource` may be accessed. The value set in `ppArray` may change every time that `pResource` is mapped.

If `pResource` is not registered, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` was not registered with usage flags cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsArray, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` is not mapped then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

For usage requirements of the `subResource` parameter, see cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer().

######  Parameters

`pPitch`
    \- Returned pitch of subresource
`pPitchSlice`
    \- Returned Z-slice pitch of subresource
`pResource`
    \- Mapped resource to access
`subResource`
    \- Subresource of pResource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Returns in `*pPitch` and `*pPitchSlice` the pitch and Z-slice pitch of the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource `pResource`, which corresponds to `subResource`. The values set in `pPitch` and `pPitchSlice` may change every time that `pResource` is mapped.

The pitch and Z-slice pitch values may be used to compute the location of a sample on a surface as follows.

For a 2D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position **x** , **y** from the base pointer of the surface is:

**y** * **pitch** \+ (**bytes per pixel**) * **x**

For a 3D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position **x** , **y** , **z** from the base pointer of the surface is:

**z*** **slicePitch** \+ **y** * **pitch** \+ (**bytes per pixel**) * **x**

Both parameters `pPitch` and `pPitchSlice` are optional and may be set to NULL.

If `pResource` is not of type ID3D10Texture1D, ID3D10Texture2D, or ID3D10Texture3D, or if `pResource` has not been registered for use with CUDA, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` was not registered with usage flags cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsNone, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` is not mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

For usage requirements of the `subResource` parameter see cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer().

######  Parameters

`pPointer`
    \- Returned pointer corresponding to subresource
`pResource`
    \- Mapped resource to access
`subResource`
    \- Subresource of pResource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Returns in `*pPointer` the base pointer of the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource `pResource` which corresponds to `subResource`. The value set in `pPointer` may change every time that `pResource` is mapped.

If `pResource` is not registered, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` was not registered with usage flags cudaD3D9RegisterFlagsNone, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` is not mapped then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

If `pResource` is of type ID3D10Buffer then `subResource` must be 0. If `pResource` is of any other type, then the value of `subResource` must come from the subresource calculation in D3D10CalcSubResource().

######  Parameters

`pSize`
    \- Returned size of subresource
`pResource`
    \- Mapped resource to access
`subResource`
    \- Subresource of pResource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Returns in `*pSize` the size of the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource `pResource` which corresponds to `subResource`. The value set in `pSize` may change every time that `pResource` is mapped.

If `pResource` has not been registered for use with CUDA then cudaErrorInvalidHandle is returned. If `pResource` was not registered with usage flags cudaD3D10RegisterFlagsNone, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If `pResource` is not mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

For usage requirements of the `subResource` parameter see cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer().

######  Parameters

`pWidth`
    \- Returned width of surface
`pHeight`
    \- Returned height of surface
`pDepth`
    \- Returned depth of surface
`pResource`
    \- Registered resource to access
`subResource`
    \- Subresource of pResource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Returns in `*pWidth`, `*pHeight`, and `*pDepth` the dimensions of the subresource of the mapped Direct3D resource `pResource` which corresponds to `subResource`.

Since anti-aliased surfaces may have multiple samples per pixel, it is possible that the dimensions of a resource will be an integer factor larger than the dimensions reported by the Direct3D runtime.

The parameters `pWidth`, `pHeight`, and `pDepth` are optional. For 2D surfaces, the value returned in `*pDepth` will be 0.

If `pResource` is not of type ID3D10Texture1D, ID3D10Texture2D, or ID3D10Texture3D, or if `pResource` has not been registered for use with CUDA, then cudaErrorInvalidHandle is returned.

For usage requirements of `subResource` parameters see cudaD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer().

######  Parameters

`pResource`
    \- Registered resource to set flags for
`flags`
    \- Parameters for resource mapping

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

###### Description

Set usage flags for mapping the Direct3D resource `pResource`.

Changes to flags will take effect the next time `pResource` is mapped. The `flags` argument may be any of the following:

  * cudaD3D10MapFlagsNone: Specifies no hints about how this resource will be used. It is therefore assumed that this resource will be read from and written to by CUDA kernels. This is the default value.

  * cudaD3D10MapFlagsReadOnly: Specifies that CUDA kernels which access this resource will not write to this resource.

  * cudaD3D10MapFlagsWriteDiscard: Specifies that CUDA kernels which access this resource will not read from this resource and will write over the entire contents of the resource, so none of the data previously stored in the resource will be preserved.


If `pResource` has not been registered for use with CUDA then cudaErrorInvalidHandle is returned. If `pResource` is presently mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

######  Parameters

`pD3D10Device`
    \- Direct3D device to use for interoperability
`device`
    \- The CUDA device to use. This device must be among the devices returned when querying cudaD3D10DeviceListAll from cudaD3D10GetDevices, may be set to -1 to automatically select an appropriate CUDA device.

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorSetOnActiveProcess

###### Deprecated

This function is deprecated as of CUDA 5.0.

###### Description

This function is deprecated and should no longer be used. It is no longer necessary to associate a CUDA device with a D3D10 device in order to achieve maximum interoperability performance.
