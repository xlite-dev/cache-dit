### Variables

unsigned char cudaGraphEdgeData::from_port


This indicates when the dependency is triggered from the upstream node on the edge. The meaning is specfic to the node type. A value of 0 in all cases means full completion of the upstream node, with memory visibility to the downstream node or portion thereof (indicated by `to_port`). Only kernel nodes define non-zero ports. A kernel node can use the following output port types: cudaGraphKernelNodePortDefault, cudaGraphKernelNodePortProgrammatic, or cudaGraphKernelNodePortLaunchCompletion.

unsigned char cudaGraphEdgeData::reserved[5]


These bytes are unused and must be zeroed. This ensures compatibility if additional fields are added in the future.

unsigned char cudaGraphEdgeData::to_port


This indicates what portion of the downstream node is dependent on the upstream node or portion thereof (indicated by `from_port`). The meaning is specific to the node type. A value of 0 in all cases means the entirety of the downstream node is dependent on the upstream work. Currently no node types define non-zero ports. Accordingly, this field must be set to zero.

unsigned char cudaGraphEdgeData::type


This should be populated with a value from cudaGraphDependencyType. (It is typed as char due to compiler-specific layout of bitfields.) See cudaGraphDependencyType.
